### Hello! Nice to meet you

I'm Ahmad Ruslan Almujaddidi. I'm INTJ, I live in Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©  I'm currently an undergraduate in Informatics Engineering at Syahid Hidayatullah State Islamic University, Jakarta. 

I first started programming in uni, using C++ in the 1st term. After the end of 1st term, I felt like I was in the wrong major and get thrown off from programming. I explore other topics unrelated to computer science like graphic design, marketing and content writing.

I came back to programming in March 2018 after I tried [git](https://try.github.io/) for the first time and fell in love with Python for its simplicity. Since then, I've regained my passion in programming and hoping that I could become better in my craft. 

My focus now is on web development and software engineering in general. I'd like to explore more topics on programming. This year, I'd like to learn Go and Flutter. Also get an internship and participate in hackathon! 

There are a lot of things that interest me; computer science, design, philosophy, psychology and habit engineering. In 2018, I started a new habit of reading books and writing essays. They've become a hobby of mine now, along with listening to music and watching weekly anime stream.

Have a great day!
