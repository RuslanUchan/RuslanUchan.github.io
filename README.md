Making website with github-pages and jekyll.

Some articles I used
1. [Jekyll Website](https://jekyllrb.com/)
2. [Jmcglone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
3. [Barry Clark tutorial](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
4. [Help on Github-pages](https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/)
5. [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

*Notes for the future*
- Update the portofolio page
- Make notes on jekyll commands in blog page, in case I want to go back to it in the future
- Add pagination on blog page
- Experiment with themes and design of pages
