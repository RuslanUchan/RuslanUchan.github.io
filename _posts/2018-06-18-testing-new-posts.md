Hello :)

This ia my first post after wrangling with jekyll for a few days.

Below is an example of highlighting code snippets. I might have to use it later. If number is needed, add "linenos" in the templating.

{% highlight python %}
print("This is a highlighted code")
{% endhighlight %}

To see 'short name' for code, look at [short name][sn]
