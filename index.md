### Hello! Nice to meet you!

Hello! I'm Ahmad Ruslan Almujaddidi. I'm an aspiring data scientist, currently an undergraduate in Informatics Engineering at Syahid Hidayatullah State Islamic University. Planning to graduate in 2021 and pursue career in data science related fields.

I've been learning about data science since January 2018 after some months of going through 'self-awareness and discovering myself' kind of phase. I'm particularly interested (as of now) in social media and text analysis. 

This is my personal site where I do my hobbies of writing and also documenting my journey as a fledgling data scientist.
